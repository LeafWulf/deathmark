# Death Mark

When installed, this module will automatically mark tokens with a configurable overlay when they run out of health.  
The status effect icon can be set by the user, and a different setting can be used for linked or unlinked tokens (e.g. dead vs dying).

## Functions

Death Mark adds an overlay icon (that can be changed in settings) to tokens that reach 0 HP.
The module is set up out-of-the-box for Pathfinder 2e only which use this path for an actor's HP (`system.attributes.hp.value`).

## Settings

## Dependencies
System Pathfinder 2E v4.8.3

## Known Issues
So far none.
